This is code for interfacing the Wii Nunchuck to an Arduino to act as a
mouse, 
taken from
[Fork Robotics](http://www.forkrobotics.com/2012/06/leonardo-wiichuck-mouse/).

The main wii code (nunchuck_funcs.h) taken from [Todd Kurt](http://www.todbot.com) of [ThingM](http://thingm.com).
See [his github
repository](http://github.com/todbot/wiichuck_adapter/) (in firmware/WiichuckDemo).

I made slight changes to avoid some duplicate code and to work with
the Arduino Leonardo.
