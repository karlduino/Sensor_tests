This is code for interfacing the Wii Nunchuck to an Arduino, as a mouse.

The main wii code (nunchuck_funcs.h) taken from [Todd Kurt](http://thingm.com)
See [his github
repository](http://github.com/todbot/wiichuck_adapter/) (in firmware/WiichuckDemo).

I made slight changes to avoid some duplicate code and to work with
the Arduino Leonardo.

The mouse example is taken from 
[Fork Robotics](http://www.forkrobotics.com/2012/06/leonardo-wiichuck-mouse/)
