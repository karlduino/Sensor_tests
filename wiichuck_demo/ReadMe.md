This is code for interfacing the Wii Nunchuck to an Arduino, taken from [Todd Kurt](http://www.todbot.com) of [ThingM](http://thingm.com).

Original obtained from [here](http://todbot.com/blog/2008/02/18/wiichuck-wii-nunchuck-adapter-available/comment-page-10/);
also see [his github
repository](http://github.com/todbot/wiichuck_adapter/), in firmware/WiichuckDemo.

I made slight changes to avoid some duplicate code and to work with
the Arduino Leonardo.
